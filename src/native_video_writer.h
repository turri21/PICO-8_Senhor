//
//  Native Video DDR3 Writer for PICO-8 on MiSTer
//
//  Maps /dev/mem at 0x3A000000 and writes 128x128 RGB565 frames
//  into a double-buffered DDR3 region. The FPGA-side pico8_video_reader
//  polls a control word and reads pixel data for native video output.
//
//  Usage:
//    NativeVideoWriter_Init();
//    // each frame:
//    NativeVideoWriter_WriteFrame(rgba_buf, 128, 128);
//    // on shutdown:
//    NativeVideoWriter_Shutdown();
